<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>  I was born in California, August 16, 1998 and growing up, I loved exploring, doing all kinds of art, and I make sure to do art that has meaning. I love mixing metaphors into my work in sending messages and I don’t stick with just one art style, but am constantly looking to new art styles to continue to explore new ways to explore how I can communicate my thoughts with people. I am studying all that I can in order to become a better artist and am studying illustration, and graphic design at UVU.  I wish to be an artist and continue to do all that I can to influence the world around me in making art that makes people stop and think about what it is trying to say. The hope is to help people understand how they can be better and have better lives through what they see in the art. Painting, digital art and drawing is what I mainly work with and I like to convey helping people see things in a different and new way through visual effects. I am also so happy when I’m making art work. It gives me a connection to socializing and being with other people. When I make art that is able to connect with others, I am able to bond with others better than speaking at times. There are times in life when words don’t do much and pictures say more. I like to say many things with art, but I also like to make people think outside of the box. Drawing things for other people and seeing the happiness in their face can be the same as giving someone a huge hug and that is my favorite part about making art work.</p>

  <p>  I make artwork that displays deep emotions of longing for connections through all sorts of art styles. I started off mostly drawing and later painting, and sculpting and have since explored many other ways of making art and expressing myself. Sometimes I like to connect with photos and mindlessly draw things from photos, and then other times, I will experiment and pull out amazing creations that get people to think and experience life on a deeper level.</p>
