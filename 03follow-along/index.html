        <h1>Declation of Indepence</h1>


<p>
  When in the Course of human events, it <strong>becomes necessary</strong> for one <b>people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, 
    the <em>seperate and equal station</em> to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. 
  </p>
<h2>Problems with the King</h2>
<ul>
<li>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</li>
 <li>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</li>
  <li>He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.</li>
</ul>
